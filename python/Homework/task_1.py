#Create a program that will add up the value of a number of
#quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. The number of each
#type of coin is input by the user. The total value is printed in
#dollars.
#Example: 
#Quarters: 5 
#Dimes: 4 
#Nickels: 3
#Pennies: 2

#The total in dollars is $1.82
#How much will be in total?

num_quarters = 5
num_dimes = 4
num_nickels = 3 
num_pennies = 2

total_value = num_quarters + num_dimes + num_nickels + num_pennies

#print(total_value) = $1.82
#print("We have" , total_value)
