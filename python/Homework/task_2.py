#Write a program that will take a given amount of
#money and return the number of dollars in quarters,
#dimes, nickels, and pennies that make up that given
#amount
#Example 1:
#Please enter your balance:
#2.36
#$2.36 will make 9 quarters 1 dime 0 nickels and 1
#pennies

num_quarters = 9
num_dimes = 1
num_pennies = 1

your_balance = num_quarters + num_dimes + num_pennies

#print(your_balance) = $2.36
#print("In", your_balance)
