#Problem 1 : Even or Odd
# We will write a program that prints True when variable 'number' is
# even, and prints False when the number is Odd.
#Odd num: 1,3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, etc.
#Even num: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, etc.
number = 104

# Even numbers are perfectly divisibly by 2, and Odd numbers not.

is_even = number % 2 == 0
