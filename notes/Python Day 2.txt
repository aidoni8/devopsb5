A variable in programming is like
a container where we can store the data.

Why do we use variables?

1. Storage
   Variable allow us to store data that we can use and modify 
   later.
2.Readability 
   Makes our code easier to understand, debug and find what the 
   data represents.
   *debug mostly means going over the code again for the purpose of
   understanding or finding the mistake.
3. Reusability
   Once a value is sorted in a variable, you can use that variable
   multiple times in different parts of your code.

   Formula Of The Variable Creation
      variablename = value 

 Naming a Variable
     Rules:
    * Variable name cannot start with a number.
    * It cannot have spaces.
    * It can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscore (_).
       *alphanumeric: numers and letters
    * Variable names are case sensitive which means
    'age' is not same 'Age'.

Naming Conventions
   * Convention -> how do you name the variable.

   There are 4 different types of naming conventions:
   
   1. Camel case 
      Naming starts with a lower case and capitalizes each words after that.
      Ex: fisrtName, lastName, areaCode, etc.
      Notes: Most of java, javascript users

   2. Pascal case
     Naming starts with a upper case and capitalizes each words after that.
     Ex: FisrtName, LastName, AreaCode, etc.

   3. Snake case
     Each word in a variable name is separated by underscore (_).
     Ex: first_name, last_name, area_code, etc.  
     Notes: Most of python users.

   4. Kebab case
     Each word in a variable name is separated by hyphen (-).
     Ex: first-name, last-name, area-code, etc
     

     NOTE: when creating a variable type of variable is auto understood
     by python.

     Type of Numerical variables
       1. Integer: Represents whole numbers.
       Ex: age = 25
       2. Float: Represents real numbers. (Numbers with decimal points.)
       Ex: weight = 190.4, avg = 8.0
       3. Complex: Represents complex numbers that has both
       imaginary and real parts.
       Ex: 5 + 4j -> 5 is the real part, 4j is the imaginary part.

Type Function
    The type () function is a built-in Python function
    used to determine the data type of a variable.
     Ex: a = 10
       print (type(a)) #output<class'int'>
         b = 10.1
       print (type(b)) #output<class'float'>
Importance:
    Helps debugging
    Useful when learning because it helps you to
    understand how python works with data types.

Creating Multiple Variables in Single Line
   We can define multiple variable on a single line,
   by separating them commas (,).
      Syntax: a, b, c = 1.1, 1. "h"

Advantage:
   Reduce the line of your code.
   More readable
   Compact code 

Assinging Multiple Variables With A Same Value
   Ex: a = b = c = d = 5
      #in the line above variable a, b, c and d will
      #be assigned with a value 5 and type of all Variables
      #will be integer.

ReAssignment in Python
    After Variables assigned with a value, we can also
    assign a new value to them.
    Ex: var1 = 6
        var1 = "d"
        var1 = 1.0
        var1 = 5 + 1j
